## ABSTRACT

Ever order from a third party delivery service and needed to cross reference Yelp ratings before ordering or wanted to know what the best rated restuarants, cafes, or bars are in New York City but did not want to manually search for the rating? Then, this project was made for you. 

The goal of this project is construct an ETL pipeline to provide a list and location of the eateries in the city that have a rating of 4.5 and higher and at least 30 reviews.
